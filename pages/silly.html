        <h2><br>MISC FUN CODE PROJECTS</h2>
        <p>Remember Myspace? Well a lot of peolpe are nostalgic for it, and someone made SpaceHey, which is essentially a project to bring back old myspace.
          One of the main selling points is the ability to massively customize your profile using HTML and CSS. Which sounded fun to me. So I made a profile, 
          and I've been messing around a lot with the customization. Check it out(warning: highly silly): <a href="https://spacehey.com/handsomegamer">Super Duper Cool and Handsome Gamer</a>
        <br>PS: hover your mouse over the P switch to make the Mario bros do a cool animation:)</p>
