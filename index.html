        <p>sorry if visually unimpressive im a programmer not a designer lol</p>
        <p>During university I did enough programming for school stuff, so I spent my free time doing other things. Guess that really bit me in the ass now that I'm job hunting 
        with a very lackluster portfolio of projects.<br>Anyway I guess I'll make the best out of what I've got. Here goes:</p>
        <p>I was part of a group project in uni where we made a little game, <a href="https://git.app.uib.no/minesweepers/inf112.22v.libgdx-template">check it out here!</a></p>
        <p>Also I guess I have <a href="https://github.com/Icyhuman/team-local-tactics">this repository</a> from a task where we were given a small game on a local client and
         were tasked with using websockets to turn it into a client-server game</p>
        <p>Finally it seems <a href="https://github.com/Sabbasn/INF265-Project1">these</a><a href="https://github.com/Sabbasn/INF265-Project2">three</a><a href="https://github.com/Sabbasn/INF265-Project3">repos</a>
         exist, which were mandatory tasks me and another guy did on neural networks</p>
