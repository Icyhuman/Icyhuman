        <h2><br>JØRGEN'S WEBSITE</h2>
        <p>Sorry if the visuals are unimpressive, doing it from scratch is more fun to me than one of those cool and sleek website builders.</p>
        <p>Anyway, hello. I'm Jørgen, and it turns out that it's a lot easier to get a programming related job if you publicly display your ability to program stuff. 
        Who could have imagined that, haha.</p>
        <p>So that's pretty much my deal. I like working with computer stuff, and if I could do that while also being paid, that would be great.</p>
        <p>But why am I making a site now, and not as a hobby during my studies, you may ask. Well, depression is terrible for your motivation. Once I have an 
        outside sorce of motivation, like grades or wages, I can push myself to work very hard on stuff. But as a hobby, when the motivation has to come from within? Not so much.<br>
        No need to worry, though. My depression has loosened its grip over the years, and I'm doing pretty good now.</p>
